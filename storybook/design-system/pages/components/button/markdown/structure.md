## Structure

A Button cannot have any element or text within 16 pixels / 1 rem of its borders. For Button groups, the primary button is positioned on the outside of the set, while the secondary button is positioned inside. For a Button with a glyph, the space between the button label and the glyph must be greater than or equal to 16 pixels / 1 rem. This is to accommodate for instances where two or more buttons with glyphs appear together.
